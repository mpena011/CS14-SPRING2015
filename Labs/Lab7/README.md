Trees:
    Advantages:
        -Ordered
        -Does not require resizing
    Disadvantages: 
        -Longer run times compared to hash tables
Hash Tables:
    Advantages:
        -Faster run times compared to self-balancing trees
    Disadvantages:
        -Unordered
        -Requires resizing in worst-case
        -Memory becomes wasted with buckets
        
Comparing the removes would also be useful. In particular, having a pop_front
or pop_back simulation would show the time differences in removing the 
lowest or highest value.
